## Introduction

This is Kimberly! She is a joyful, independent, and resilient person. Unfortunately, Kimberly lives with the following disabilities:
* 90% hearing loss, which constitutes profound deafness.
* Retinitis pigmentosa affects her peripheral vision, diminishes her capability to see colours and in dim light.

Currently, Kimberly uses Signia Hearing Aids, a white cane, and many apps on her phone for support in her daily life.
Despite these assistive technologies, Kimberly still faces many challenges to living independently within her daily environment. 

In this project, me and my 3 other group members will assist with one challenge she faces, Microwave usage.

## Note Before Flashing Code To ESP32
#### To ensure that the code compiles create a new "password.h" file in the "src" folder with the following code (replace the placeholders in the string text)
```C++
const char* userSSID = "YOUR NETWORK NAME HERE";
const char* userPASSWORD = "YOUR NETWORK PASSWORD HERE";
```
